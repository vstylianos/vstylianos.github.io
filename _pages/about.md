I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, supervised by the amazing [William Yeoh](https://yeoh-lab.wustl.edu/). 

My current research is anchored in the realm of human-aware AI, with a pointed focus on using logic-based techniques to augment the explainability of systems involved in sequential decision-making. My overarching research goal is to create AI systems capable of engaging and collaborating with humans in a manner that resonates with human cognition and understanding.

Within a preceding historical epoch, I received a MSc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Southampton (UK), supervised by [Long Tran-Thanh](https://human-agentlearning.github.io/HAL-LAB.html), a MSc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Glasgow (UK), supervised by [Radostin Simitev](https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~rs/), and finally a BSc. in Statistics and Actuarial-Financial Mathematics from the University of the Aegean (GR), supervised by [Nikolaos Kavallaris](https://www.kau.se/forskare/nikos-kavallaris).
