I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, supervised by the amazing [William Yeoh](https://yeoh-lab.wustl.edu/). 

My current research interest is centered on developing *human-aware* decision-making frameworks for enabling and enhancing human-AI collaboration. My work is inherently interdisciplinary and requires drawing ideas from a confluence of approaches such as knowledge representation & reasoning, planning, machine learning, as well as philosophy, cognitive science, and psychology.

Within a preceding historical epoch, I received a MSc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Southampton (UK), supervised by [Long Tran-Thanh](https://human-agentlearning.github.io/HAL-LAB.html), a MSc. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Glasgow (UK), supervised by [Radostin Simitev](https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~rs/), and finally a BSc. in Statistics and Actuarial-Financial Mathematics from the University of the Aegean (GR), supervised by [Nikolaos Kavallaris](https://www.kau.se/forskare/nikos-kavallaris).
